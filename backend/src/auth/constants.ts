stuff on them You know Grab his bones to make you brave You know the whole Ogre trick Oh you know what Maybe I could have decapitated entire village and put their heads on plate Got a knife cut open their spleens and drink their fluids Does that sound good to you A no not really no For your information there is a lot more to Ogres than people think Example Example OK Aam Ogres are like onions They stink Yes no O they make you cry No Oh you leave them out on the sun and they get all brown and start little wild hairs No Layers Onions have layers Ogres have layers Onions have layers You get it We both have layers O you both have layers You know not everybody likes onions Cake Everybody loves cakes Cakes have layers I dont care what everyone likes Ogres are not like cakes You know what

enough but look at the location Oh Shrek remember when you said that Ogres have layers Oh yeah Well I have a confession to make Donkeys dont have layers We wear sleeves Wait a second Donkeys dont have sleeves You know what I mean Oh you cant tell me youre afraid of highs No Im just a little uncomfortable of being on a rickety bridge over boiling lake of lava Come on donkey Im right here beside you Ok For emotional support Well just hackle this thing together one little baby step after time Really Really really Ok That makes me feel so much better Just keep moving and dont look down Dont look down dont look down Shrek Im looking down I cant do this Just let me off right now please But youre already half way Yeah but I know that half is safe Ok fine I dont have time for this You go back
